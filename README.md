Flexibility	Highly adaptable to changes	Rigid, changes are difficult once planning is complete
Project Phases	Continuous cycles (sprints)	Defined phases (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment)
Customer Involvement	High – frequent feedback and collaboration	Low – customer sees product mainly at the end
Delivery Timeline	Frequent releases of working software	Delivered as a complete product at the end
Risk Management	Risks are identified early and adjusted throughout	Risks are only addressed at later stages
Documentation	Lightweight, focuses on working software	Heavy documentation before development starts
Best Suited For	Complex, evolving projects	Well-defined, structured projects

Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Methodology
Agile Methodology
✅ Advantages:
1.Flexibility & Adaptability – Can quickly respond to requirement changes.
2.Frequent Delivery – Working software is delivered in short cycles (sprints).
3.Customer Collaboration – Continuous involvement improves satisfaction.
4.Early Issue Detection – Frequent testing reduces defects in later stages.
❌ Disadvantages:

What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable components. It breaks the project down into phases, tasks, and deliverables, ensuring that every aspect is accounted for.
Key Features of a WBS:
🔹 Tree-like structure – Breaks the project into levels (e.g., main project → phases → tasks → subtasks).
🔹 Deliverable-focused – Each section represents a tangible outcome.
🔹 Hierarchical organization – From broad objectives to specific work packages.
✅ Why is WBS Useful?
1.Improves Project Clarity & Organization – Defines what needs to be done at each stage.
2.Enhances Time & Budget Estimates – Helps in accurate cost forecasting and scheduling.
3.Facilitates Team Coordination – Assigns responsibilities clearly to different team members.
4.Aids Risk Management – Identifies potential bottlenecks early.
5.Supports Progress Tracking – Helps measure completion rates against milestones.

Example of a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for a Software Project:
📌 Project: Develop an E-commerce Website
Planning PhaseDefine Requirements
1.Create Wireframes & Prototypes
2.Approve Project Scope
Development Phase
1.Frontend Development (UI/UX, Homepage, Product Pages)
2.Backend Development (Database, API, Authentication)
3.Integration with Payment Gateway
Testing Phase
1.Unit Testing
2.Security Testing
3.User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Deployment & Maintenance
1.Deploy to Production
2.Monitor Performance
3.Provide Bug Fixes & Updates
By using a WBS, project managers can break complex projects into structured, manageable tasks, ensuring efficiency, accountability, and successful delivery. 

7.What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?A detailed project schedule outlines tasks, timelines, dependencies, and resources, ensuring that the project progresses smoothly.

How Gantt Charts Assist in Project Scheduling
A Gantt chart is a visual project management tool that displays tasks along a timeline, showing start and end dates, task dependencies, and progress. It provides an intuitive way to plan, track, and manage projects.
📊 How Gantt Charts Help:
🔹 Visualizes the Project Timeline – Displays task durations and deadlines in an easy-to-read format.
🔹 Shows Task Dependencies – Identifies which tasks must be completed before others begin.
🔹 Tracks Progress in Real-Time – Allows managers to update tasks and monitor delays.
🔹 Helps with Resource Planning – Ensures that no team members are over- or under-utilized.
🔹 Aids in Risk Management – Quickly identifies scheduling conflicts and delays.

Example of How a Gantt Chart is Used in a Software Development Project:
📌 Project: Develop a Mobile Banking App
Task	Start Date	End Date	Duration	Dependencies
Requirements Gathering	March 1	March 10	10 days	-
UI/UX Design	March 11	March 25	15 days	Requirements Gathering
Backend Development	March 26	April 20	25 days	UI/UX Design
Frontend Development	April 5	April 30	25 days	UI/UX Design
Testing	May 1	May 15	15 days	Backend & Frontend Development
Deployment	May 16	May 20	5 days	Testing
In a Gantt chart, each task is represented as a horizontal bar, showing how long it will take and how tasks overlap.

Why Use Gantt Charts?
✅ Great for tracking progress and identifying delays.
✅ Ensures smooth collaboration between teams.
✅ Helps project managers adjust schedules dynamically.
By using a Gantt chart, teams can stay on schedule, manage dependencies effectively, and ensure timely project delivery.
